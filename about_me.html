    <p class="centerabout">I was born in Bangladesh, a country located in South Asia. While my memories from early
        childhood are somewhat vague, I have always felt a deep connection to my birthplace. The sense of longing for my
        homeland and the presence of my loved ones remains strong. As the first generation in my family to immigrate to
        the United States, I was presented with a wealth of opportunities that have significantly shaped my journey as a
        young immigrant woman. This transition has allowed me to embrace new challenges while maintaining a strong
        cultural connection to my roots.</p>
