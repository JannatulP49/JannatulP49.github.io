        <h3><u>JANNATUL PRITY </u></h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jannatul Prity and I am an 11th grade student at Bedford Academy High School. I come from a
            South Asian, Bangladeshi background and I am currently enrolled in the STEAM program at my school, where I
            have been developing my skills in full-stack web development, learning coding languages and applying them to
            create websites and games. Beyond my academic coursework, I have participated in several internships,
            including my current role at the Free Black Women Library, and I have taken the initiative to enroll in
            college-level courses to enhance my readiness for the college. I am a hardworking and driven student who
            can't wait for the opportunity to engage in any job opportunity available.
